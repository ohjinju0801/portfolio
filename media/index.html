			<p>There are many ways to travel to the North Pole
				First of all, I'm going to decide which country in the Arctic Circle will be the base
				You can decide. The Arctic faces Russia, Alaska, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.</p>

							<p>The most common way for Europeans to travel to the
							   North Pole is to comfortably cruise through the Arctic Ocean.
							   You don't have to visit the North Pole because you can still enjoy the view there. 
							   In the case of Norway, people travel from the capital Oslo to Rungie Urban in Svalbard,
								and then take a cruise around the islands to the North Pole.</p>

							<p>A trip that is highly difficult and experiences extreme environments 
								is a trip by snow sledding toward the North Pole. In Canada,
								they travel by light aircraft to the northernmost resort route,
								then to the Eureka camp, and then use snow sledding to
								reach the North Pole over a period of more than two months.</p>

							<p>The most expensive helicopter trip in Greenland is to take an Airbus from the capital
							   Copenhagen to Kangaroo Suak Airport in West Greenland, and back to Kangaroo Suak
							   A small Dash 8 light aircraft travels through small airports in West and East Greenland
							   to explore the surrounding villages and enjoy hiking.</p>

							<p>If you went to the Arctic, if you think we have to take the Arctic points,
								they should travel to the ice and travel line.I feel like 90 degrees in the ice.
								When we reach the Arctic, it's not so long, I put it on the camera
								It's good.</p>

					<p>Traveling to the North Pole is a step up to climate change,

						I wonder if anyone wants to go on a trip to the lively and terrifying unknown.</p>

			<h3>animal</h3>

				<p>Animals have difficulty surviving on land where the ground is freezing. 
					So animals in the Arctic have thick fur coats. In addition,
					the fat layer is very thick so that body temperature is not taken away.
					Many of the animals in the Arctic are endangered or are likely to
					face a crisis sooner or later.

			<h3>Signature Dish</h3>
		<ul>
				<li><p>The "fishless" recipe for Arctic Ukha fish soup stems 
					from its proximity to the Barents Sea, which is home to Arctic crabs.
					It is as easy for locals to catch fresh crabs as making bread.</p>
					<p class="p2">Crab is used to make broth with kelp, crabmeat, 
						shrimp, scallops, and cloud berries
						(Arctic local berries that look like orange raspberries and taste like blackberries).
						This is a recipe from Svetlana Kozeiko, head chef at Tsarskaya Okhota restaurant.</p>

			   <p><strong>“I want to live”</strong><br> At some point, 
				the Earth is crying out for our lives. It's changing little by
				 little every year, but in the long run, the Arctic ice volume is
				  expected to decrease significantly. Therefore, the Arctic is the fastest-growing 
				  region of warming. It is judged by the presence or absence of annual
				   ice to determine how healthy glaciers are during the ice melt season.</p>
				<p>Last year was the year with the least annual ice,
					This year, there are not many ice cubes left. 
				    In Korea, there are also concerns that the patterns of the four seasons,
					which were clear due to the effects of global warming,
					will gradually disappear. Contrary to these concerns, 
					we do not know about the seriousness until we feel it firsthand. Just in time,
					fonts have emerged that will inform us of the seriousness of the climate crisis 
					and create opportunities for awakening once again.</p>
