				<li>
					<p>If you want to enjoy hot springs and travel together,
						Europe is a good choice. This is because there are many different
						hot spring attractions in Europe. One hot spring attraction is
						the hot spring Blue Lagoon, which represents the Arctic Circle,
						and it is a representative tourist attraction in Iceland that 
						tourists visit at least once. There are also attractions that
						are not well known to Koreans, so you will be able to have a 
						more special experience if you visit them in person.</p>

					<dd>As it is close to the ground, aurora is a fantasy of light that is embroidered in the winter sky as if pouring down in front of the eyes. In photos, aurora is mostly green, but in reality, it spreads out in various ways, including red, blue, and purple. However, as white nights continue in non-European summer,
					rora can only be seen clearly in winter skies.</dd>

		<h3>Igloo</h3>
		<p>Make the Inuit house "Igloo" that lives in the Arctic Circle step by step with snow.
			It's possible because it's a Niseko with a lot of snow. 
			An igloo is made by making a lump of snow, cutting it into blocks,
			and stacking the blocks into a dome. It is a practical building that is sturdy,
			wind-resistant, and warm inside, so it can be helpful for emergency homelessness in winter
			mountains. Many people want to sleep late at night because 
			it's so comfortable to relax in a homemade igloo after completion.

			<h3>Stonehenge</h3>
			<p class="p1">Set in Raufarhöfn, one of the most remote and northernmost villages in
					Iceland where the Arctic Circle lies just off the coast,
					the Arctic Henge (Heimskautsgerðið) is under construction.
					Similar to its ancient predecessor, Stonehenge,
					the Arctic Henge is like a huge sundial, aiming to capture the sunrays,
					cast shadows in precise locations and capture the light between aligned gateways.
					Heimskautsgerðið (The Arctic-Henge) has it s roots in the innovators Erlingur Thoroddsen’s 
					speculations about the possibility to use endless vistas, where nothing obstructs the horizon,
					and the midnight sun.  The idea to use the dwarf names from the eddic poem Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress) and modernize some aspects
					of the old world of the Sagas, soon became a part of these speculations.
					The first version of the idea is from 1998 but in 2004 it was finalized,
					with allusions to mythology and folklore, designed to interact with the unique natural light. 
					The designer of the project is Haukur Halldórsson.
					No one has been able to explain the dwarfs in the Völuspá, apart from Austri (East),
					Vestri (West), Norðri (North) and Suðri (South), who carry the sky.</p> 
			<p class="p2">By connecting the names of the dwarfs to the season, as for example Bjartur 
					(Bright) Blíður (Sweet) and Svásuður (Gengle) to the summer, it is possible to 
					fit the names of the dwarfs to a yearly circle of 72 weeks.  The year-circle of the dwarfs
					becomes a kind of almanac, where each dwarf controls a five day period.  All the dwarfs have been given a role and 
					they have all have their own personalities. 
					This means that the dwarfs can be connected to birthdays and people can connect to their personal dwarf.
					Around this made up world rises the Heimskautsgerði (Arctic-Henge) on the Melrakkaás (Foxhill) in Raufarhöfn. 
					The Heimskautsgerði is around 50 meters in diameter, with 6 meter high gates that face the main directions. 
					Between the gates is a high wall with a small opening at the top.  Inside the circle stands 10 meter high column on four pillars.
					The column will be topped with cut prism-glass that splits up the sunlight unto the primary colors.
					The opening between the pillar look towards the main directions, so example the midnight 
					sun can be seen from the south gate through the middle column and the north gate.
					The play of light and shadow will follow the time of the day. 
					The openings on the wall will let in the sunrays so when the building is completed a sundial can be set up.
					Inside the circle are 68 dwarfs who stand around a circular dwarf trail.  
					Inside the trail is the polar star pointer, and does exactly what its name says.
					There you can also find the throne of the sun that is meant to be a place where the traveler can sit down to have his picture taken. 
					 Also a hall of rays, which is a sort of sanctuary between high columns, with one seat, where the guest can empty his mind an renew 
					 his energy.</p>

		<h3>dogtrain</h3>
		<p>Sled dog tours are a continuously
			growing industry in Iceland.
			In addition to the uniqueness that they are only 
			possible in the subarctic region, they are gaining 
			huge popularity with their beautiful natural environment.
			With the increasing number of tourists from all over the world
			visiting Iceland, sled dogs are outpacing the popularity of
			Icelandic sheepdog in many ways. The best feature of Icelandic 
			sled dogs is that they pull the sled for pleasure. It is not
			just for human enjoyment. Sled dogs also feel great joy when they pull the sled..</p>
